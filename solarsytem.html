    <h2>Solar System Overveiw:</h2>
    <p>The solar system has one star, eight planets, five dwarf planets, at least 290 moons, more than 1.3 million asteroids, and about 3,900 comets. It is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.

        We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris – along with hundreds of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

    <h3>A detailed guide to the night sky written by a NASA expert featuring full Moon lore, asteroid flybys, stars, galaxies, constellations, and more.</h3>
    <p><pre>
        Here for your reference is a day-by-day listing of celestial events between now and the full Moon after next. The times and angles are based on the location of NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC,
        and some of these details may differ for where you are (I use parentheses to indicate times specific to the DC area). 
Wednesday evening into Thursday morning, April 17 to 18, 2024, the bright star Regulus will be to the lower left of the waxing gibbous Moon. As twilight ends (at 8:49 PM EDT)Regulus will be 7.5 degrees
from the Moon. When Regulus sets on the west-northwestern horizon (at 4:12 AM) it will be 4.5 degrees from the Moon.

Thursday evening into Friday morning, April 18 to 19, 2024, the waxing gibbous Moon will have shifted to the other side of the bright star Regulus. As twilight ends (at 8:50 PM EDT) Regulus will be 6 degrees
to the upper right of the Moon. About 1 hour later (at 9:53 PM) the Moon will reach its highest for the night with Regulus 6 degrees to the right. Regulus will rotate clockwise and away from the Moon as the 
night progresses, reaching about 8 degrees to the lower right around 3 AM.

Friday night, April 19, 2024, at 10:09 PM EDT, the waxing gibbous Moon will be at apogee, its farthest from the Earth for this orbit. Friday morning, April 19, 2024, will be the first morning that the planet 
Mercury will rise on the eastern horizon more than 30 minutes before sunrise, a very rough estimate of the earliest it might start being visible in the glow of dawn. Mercury will be quite faint, but will brighten
each morning as it shows a larger illuminated crescent towards the Earth. However, this will not be a favorable apparition for Mercury viewing, as even at its highest it will not rise before twilight begins.

Sunday, April 21, 2024 will be when the comet 12P/Pons-Brooks will be at its closest to the Sun. The week or two before this might be a good time to look for this comet with binoculars. If the trail of gas and 
dust the comet is giving off doesn't change significantly (a very big and uncertain "if") then the brightness of the comet should increase to a maximum on April 21. However, interference from the light of the waxing
Moon will also increase beginning April 9, and the comet will shift closer to the horizon each evening. As twilight ends on April 21 (at 8:53 PM EDT) the Moon will be 96% illuminated and the comet will be only 2.7 
degrees above the horizon. April 24 will be the last evening the comet will be above the horizon before evening twilight ends (at 8:57 PM). 

Monday, April 22, 2024, is International Mother Earth Day. See https://www.un.org/en/observances/earth-day for more information. 

Monday evening into Tuesday morning, April 22 to 23, 2024, the bright star Spica will be to the lower right of the full Moon. Spica will be a little more than 1 degree from the Moon as twilight ends and will shift 
closer until little before midnight, after which they will separate again. Spica will be 1 degree from the Moon as the Moon reaches its highest for the night (at 12:31 AM EDT) and will be 2.5 degrees from the Moon 
as twilight begins (at 5:18 AM). 

As mentioned above, the full Moon will be Tuesday evening, April 23, 2024, at 7:49 PM EDT. This will be on Wednesday from the time zones of the UK, Ireland, and Portugal eastward across Europe, Africa, Asia, and 
Australia to the International Date Line. The Moon will appear full for about 3 days centered on this time, from Monday morning to Thursday morning.

Friday morning, April 26, 2024, the bright star Antares will be near the waning gibbous Moon. Antares will be about 8 degrees to the lower left around midnight, about 7 degrees to the left around the time the Moon 
reaches its highest for the night (at 2:48 AM EDT), and about 6 degrees to the upper left as morning twilight begins (at 5:13 AM). For parts of the Arabian Peninsula, the Horn of Africa, and the Indian Ocean, the 
Moon will actually block Antares from view. See http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/bstar/0426zc2366.htm for a map and information on the areas that can see this occultation. 

By late Friday night into Saturday morning, April 26 to 27, 2024, the waning gibbous Moon will have moved to the other side of the bright star Antares. As the Moon rises (at 11:09 PM EDT)Antares will be 4 degrees 
to the upper right, and will shift clockwise and away from the Moon as the night progresses, appearing 6 degrees to the upper right when the Moon is at its highest(at 3:42 AM) and 7 degrees to the lower right as 
morning twilight begins (at 5:12 AM).
